 * @deprecated since version 1.9.8
 * @deprecated We have reorganized and simplified the Authorize.Net API to ease integration and to focus on merchants' needs.
 * @deprecated We have deprecated AIM, ARB, CIM, and Reporting as separate options, in favor of AuthorizeNet::API (package: net.authorize.api.*).
 * @deprecated We have also deprecated SIM as a separate option, in favor of Accept Hosted. See https://developer.authorize.net/api/reference/features/accept_hosted.html for details on Accept Hosted.
 * @deprecated For details on AIM, see https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sample-code-java/tree/master/src/main/java/net/authorize/sample/PaymentTransactions.
